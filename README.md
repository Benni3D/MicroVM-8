# MicroVM-8
A small 8 bit VM for people, that want to learn Assembly. Including Assembler in Java.
The VM has many usefull instructions, like for copying data or comparing Strings.
This project don't have dependencies.
Only the JRE, but the most have it on the Computer.

# Assembler
The Assembler was written in Java, because I like parsing Strings in Java.
It is faster to write, than in C/C++.
You have to install the JRE 1.8.0 to use the Assembler. 

# Notepad++ Integration
In this project I added a file named "Notepad++ Language.xml".
You can import it simple in Notepad++.

# Installation
Copy the executable to a folder on your Computer and add him to the PATH-Variable.

# Examples
In the folder example you can find examples to the assembly.
